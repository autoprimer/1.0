# AutoPrimer 1.0

AutoPrimer is a clinician-friendly software programme for the design of exonic PCR primers. It comprises the core program autoprimer.py and the graphical user interface autoprimer_gui.py. In the workflow implemented, the user is just required to provide the gene name and select a transcript; primers are automatically designed with primer-binding site SNP avoidance, exon tiling and iterative parameter adjustments.

- To execute the command-line program, you will need Python 3.5+ and internet access.
- To execute the GUI script autoprimer_gui.py, you will additionally require PyQt5.
